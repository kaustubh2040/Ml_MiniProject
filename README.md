🩺 Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to predict whether a person is diabetic or not based on key medical parameters such as glucose level, BMI, blood pressure, insulin level, and age.
The dataset used is the PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset, a standard dataset for binary classification in healthcare analytics.
